Save/LoadPartial
    - Save shapes to file as they are added to the list
    - Add new mark to end of file on saves to determine full completion
    - If not full completion, compare the 2nd last blocks of the partial save
        - determine when a new root was used
        - find that roots position in fully completed (size-1) save
        - begin processing using that root, and any afterwards
        - nomino list to check against will be the full partial save
    - Requires SIGINT handler to close file for proper write
        - Could also write out the last completed root for better resume speed

Multithreading Support
    - Will be very easy once updated algorithm in place (in theory)
    - Keep global pointer to next available root to expand
    - Locks/checks around accessing this pointer
    - Thread takes the root, sets pointer to root->next, expands on that root
    - Store 'children' in global array similar to other global pointer
    - For now, join threads after expansion and do verification step on single thread

Optimize compare
    - consider using (possibly binary) insertion sort when adding blocks, which would
        reduce the amount of operations in each compare call (On2 -> Onlogn)
