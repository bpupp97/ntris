Save/LoadPartial
    - Save shapes to file as they are added to the list
    - Add new mark to end of file on saves to determine full completion
    - If not full completion, compare the 2nd last blocks of the partial save
        - determine when a new root was used
        - find that roots position in fully completed (size-1) save
        - begin processing using that root, and any afterwards
        - nomino list to check against will be the full partial save
    - Requires SIGINT handler to close file for proper write
        - Could also write out the last completed root for better resume speed

Updated Verification Algorithm
    - Similar to a merge sort algorithm
    - Generate list of 'children' nodes corresponding to 'root' nodes used to create them
        - Each pass of genNominos will only compare duplicates from the same root
    - For each list of children nodes:
        - Compare to all previous root nodes
            - if root node shape found within child, remove child
        - Add remaining children to global list 
    - global list becomes new list of 'root' nodes, expand until size is reached

Multithreading Support
    - Will be very easy once updated algorithm in place (in theory)
    - Keep global pointer to next available root to expand
    - Locks/checks around accessing this pointer
    - Thread takes the root, sets pointer to root->next, expands on that root
    - Store 'children' in global array similar to other global pointer
    - For now, join threads after expansion and do verification step on single thread

Optimize compare
    - Instead of counting matches count mismatches, if mismatches > size difference exit fail

Fix validation
    - For all 4 rotations:
        - Check all 5 offsets of child (0, x+, x-, y+, y-) for root, normalized
